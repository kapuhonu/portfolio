<h2>Hello world!</h2>

<p>This is a demonstration of a portfolio group.</p>

<p>"I say!" said Ogilvy; "help keep these idiots back.  We don't know what's in the confounded thing, you know!"</p>

<p>I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was, standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again. The crowd had pushed him in.</p>

<p>The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within.  Nearly two feet of shining screw projected.  Somebody blundered against me, and I narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw.  I turned, and as I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid of the cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion.  I stuck my elbow into the person behind me, and turned my head towards the Thing again.  For a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black. I had the sunset in my eyes.</p>

<p>I think everyone expected to see a man emerge--possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man.  I know I did.  But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two luminous disks--like eyes.  Then something resembling a little grey snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me--and then another.</p>

<p>A sudden chill came over me.  There was a loud shriek from a woman behind.  I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still, from which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my way back from the edge of the pit.  I saw astonishment giving place to horror on the faces of the people about me.  I heard inarticulate exclamations on all sides.  There was a general movement backwards. I saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit.  I found myself alone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off, Stent among them.  I looked again at the cylinder, and ungovernable terror gripped me.  I stood petrified and staring.</p>

<p>A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder.  As it bulged up and caught the light, it glistened like wet leather.</p>
